In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

3. Development

- File-based routing: This app has two screens: app/(tabs)/ index.tsx and app/(tabs)/explore.tsx. The layout file in app/(tabs)/\_layout.tsx sets up the tab navigator.

- Android, iOS, and web support: You can open this project on Android, iOS, and the web. To open the web version, press w in the terminal running this project.

- Images: For static images, you can use the @2x and @3x suffixes to provide files for different screen densities

- Custom fonts: Open app/\_layout.tsx to see how to load custom fonts such as this one.

- Light and dark mode components: This app has light and dark mode support. The useColorScheme) hook lets you inspect what the user's current color scheme is, and so you can adjust Ul colors accordingly.

- Animations: This template includes an example of an animated component. The components/ HelloWave.tsx component uses the powerful react-native-reanimated library to create a waving hand animation. The components/ParallaxScrollView.tsx component provides a parallax effect for the header image.
